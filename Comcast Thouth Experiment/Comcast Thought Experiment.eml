Folks,

I've been doing a bit of a thought experiment.  I'd love your thoughts on i=
f it holds together.

Comcast is interested in working with us for a customer loyalty program.  W=
e have a strong relationship there through our investors.  As a first step,=
 we compared our audiences to see how much of our Fan Graph overlapped with=
 their households.

In the test we did, LIMGC provided 42MM profiles from Krux.  Comcast found =
that our IDs matched with 22% of their 28.2MM households.  The IDs were mat=
ched through LiveRamp.

Obviously, the higher the match rate, the better.  But nobody really knows =
how to feel about the 22% number.  Is the overlap strong enough?  Is there =
any reason to think something went wrong with matching?

To try to answer this question, I wanted to figure out what the match rate =
of a random audience might be.  Essentially, if you had two randomly genera=
ted audience lists, how much overlap would there be?  To do this, I used a =
random number generator to create two separate lists with the random number=
 as a proxy for the audience IDs.  The random number generator picked uniqu=
e numbers between 1 to 285MM (size of the US online population).  One list =
was 42MM to represent LIMGC.  The other was 28.2MM to represent Comcast.  O=
nce I had the two lists, I looked at the intersection between them.

After running this a few times, I found that the overlap between the two li=
sts was ~15% (using the pseudo-Comcast list as the denominator).

My conclusion is that if you have two totally randomly determined audiences=
 the same sizes as the LIMGC and Comcast audiences you should expect a 15% =
overlap.  Since the overlap between the real audiences was 22%, the LIMGC a=
nd Comcast audiences overlap 50% better than random.

The real question is whether or not the 6.2MM household audience is large e=
nough to build an interesting program.  But I think we should be reasonably=
 satisfied that our audience overlap is interesting.

This is the first time I=92ve thought of this issue in this way.  Does it w=
ork?  I=92m trying to convince myself as much as anyone that this means any=
thing so please poke any holes you see.

Thanks,

Kevin
